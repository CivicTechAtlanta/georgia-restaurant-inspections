# Inspectr

This Ruby on Rails app takes restaurant inspection data from publicly available websites and makes it easy to access to the public.  The data is contributed to the Socrata OpenData portal, as well as OpenStreetMap.   We are starting with Atlanta, then scaling to Georgia.

In addition to the Ruby framework, this repo contains documentation on data cleaning and analysis, primarily in R, and involving externally-sourced datasets.  See subfolders [/data_getting_cleaning] (https://github.com/codeforatlanta/inspectr/tree/master/data_getting_cleaning) and [/data_analysis] (http://github.com/codeforatlanta/inspectr/tree/master/data_analysis)

This project started on 6/6/15 at the 2015 Atlanta Hack for Change event, sponsored by [Code For Atlanta] (www.codeforatlanta.org)
