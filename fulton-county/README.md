# Inspectr

This Ruby on Rails app takes restaurant inspection data from publicly available websites and makes it easy to access to the public.  The data is contributed to the Socrata OpenData portal, as well as OpenStreetMap.

Scraped data saved in [fulton-county/inspection_data](../fulton-county/inspection_data)

This project started on 6/6/15 at the 2015 Atlanta Hack for Change event, sponsored by [Code For Atlanta] (www.codeforatlanta.org)
